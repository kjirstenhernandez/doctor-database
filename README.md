# Overview

This software provides access to public contact information for various healthcare providers and offices across Utah. Registered users can view the database, while administrators have permissions to add, edit, and delete contact records.

The application utilizes Google Cloud for OAuth authentication, MongoDB as the database, and Swagger for API documentation and testing.

Effective interoffice communication is essential for optimal patient care, whether for continuity of care, medical follow-ups, records requests, or referrals. However, obtaining accurate contact information for other offices can often be challenging and time-consuming. This software aims to streamline that process, improving communication across Utah's healthcare system and ultimately enhancing patient care.

# Development Environment

The project was developed using Visual Studio Code, with JavaScript and EJS as the primary technologies.
